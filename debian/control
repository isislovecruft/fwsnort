Description: Firewall Snort 
 Fwsnort translates Snort rules into iptables rule approximations and generates
 a Bourne shell script that implements the resulting iptables commands.
 .
 This ruleset allows network  traffic  that  exhibits  Snort signatures to be 
 logged and/or dropped by iptables directly without putting any interface into
 promiscuous mode or  queuing  packets  from kernel  to  user  space.
