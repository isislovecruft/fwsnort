This directory contains perl modules and other dependencies used by fwsnort.
These dependencies are included in this directory to ease the installation
process, but if fwsnort is being installed on a system where all necessary
dependencies are already installed then it is recommended to install from one
of the fwsnort "nodeps" tarballs or RPM's.  These distributions of fwsnort do
not include any perl modules or other dependencies:
