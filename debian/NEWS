fwsnort (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The ability to build an fwsnort policy that utilizes ip6tables instead
  of iptables is now available. This allows fwsnort filtering and altering
  capabilities to apply to IPv6 traffic instead of just IPv4 traffic.
  To enable ip6tables usage, use the "-6" or "--ip6tables" command line
  arguments.

  Fwsnort now creates logs in the /var/log/fwsnort/ directory instead of
  directly in the /var/log/ directory. The path is controlled by a new
  variable 'LOG_FILE' in the /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.conf file.

  Snort rules can easily be tested by the use of the new
   --include-perl-triggers command line argument. This argument instructs
  fwsnort to include 'perl -e print ... ' commands as comments in the
  /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh script, and these commands can be combined
  with netcat to send payloads across the wire that match Snort
  rules.
