Thomas Bullinger
    - Contributed patches for the --no-jumps option
    - Wrote the makefwsnort.sh script to download the latest stable snort
      rules.
    - Bugfix for correct IP protocol number.
    - Bugfix for missed --ipt-script option.
    - Suggested the ability to specify multiple sid's with the --snort-sids
      option.

Paul O'Neil
    - Discovered missed DMZ interface code bug.

Ahmad Almulhem
    - Suggested --ipt-tos and --ipt-mark options
    - Suggested ability to manually specify interface networks instead of
      automatically parsing the output of ifconfig.  This allows fwsnort to be
      run on a system where no IP is assigned to an interface such as a linux
      box that is acting as a bridge.

Hank Leininger
    - Suggested the combination of the QUEUE target and string matching as a
      way to speed up inline Snort implementations.  This suggestion was made
      at a talk I gave about Linux Firewalls at ShmooCon 2007, and the
      --NFQUEUE and --QUEUE command line arguements were the result.

Grant Ferley
    - Submitted patch to exclude loopback interfaces from iptables allow rules
      parsing.  This behavior can be reversed with the existing
      --no-exclude-loopback command line argument.
    - Submitted patch to IPTables::Parse to take into account iptables policy
      output that contains "0" instead of "all" to represent any protocol.
    - Suggested bugfix to allow negated networks to be specified within
      iptables allow rules or within the fwsnort.conf file.

Franck Joncourt
    - Submitted patch to fix double dash format in fwsnort man page.
    - Architected the process of packaging fwsnort (and the other Cipherdyne
      projects) for the Debian Linux distribution.
