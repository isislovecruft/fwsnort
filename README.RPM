NOTE: Before building an RPM manually for your Linux system, it is recommended
to try installing fwsnort via the standard software install mechanism for your
distribution since fwsnort is available in many distribution software
repositories.  For example, you can try installing fwsnort with 'yum' or
'apt-get' depending on the type of Linux distribution that you are running.

Building RPM files that are compatible with all possible Linux distributions
is a difficult task.  If a given RPM file that is downloaded from
http://www.cipherdyne.org/ is not compatible with your particular Linux
distro, then you can use the "cd_rpmbuilder" ("CipherDyne RPM Builder") to
build an RPM file for you on your own system.

The command line interface to cd_rpmbuilder is simple, and one command line
argument is always required "-p <project>" so that cd_rpmbuilder knows which
CipherDyne software project you want to build:

    # cd_rpmbuilder -p <project>

Note that cd_rpmbuilder is normally as root because it builds RPM's within
the /usr/src/redhat/ directory by default.  However, if you would like to
build as a normal user within a directory of your choosing you can do:

    # cd_rpmbuilder -p <project> -r <dir>

By default, cd_rpmbuilder builds the latest version of the specified project,
but if you want to build an older version, use the -b flag:

    # cd_rpmbuilder -p <project> -b <version>

If you want to see verbose output (including all output of the system
rpmbuild command), then use the -v flag:

    # cd_rpmbuilder -p <project> -v

Finally, here is some sample output for building the psad project available
at http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/:

    # ./cd_rpmbuilder -p psad
